# This is the code book for the course project

Requirements for this project are:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# activity_labels.txt
This table includes two columns: classLabels, activityName
classLabels: numeric number identifier of each activity
activityName: descriptive names of each activity

# features.txt
This table includes two columns: index, featureNames
index: numeric identifier for each feature
featureNames: feature name in the train and test dataset

# X_train.txt, X_test.txt
These tables include activity measurements for train and test dataset

# Y_train.txt, Y_test.txt
These tables include numeric identifier for each activity

# subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt
These tables include numeric identifier for subjects in train and test dataset
